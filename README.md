We need to have 4 files (3 HTML files and 1 CSS file) linked together for this project. For This Project:
added the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. Created 3 HTML files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`. Linked Bootstrap CSS link in my file and also created my own CSS file to add some manual changes. I used Bootstrap for several reasons;
   1-for a navbar
   2- for responsive layout and responsive images
   3- Bootstrap components and grid system.
   4- made a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on portfolio site
* Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).
Added Bootstrap” class “to adjust the responsive `xs` screen, content to take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens. Added margins on the left and right sides of the screen.
Used https://validator.w3.org/to ensure that each page has valid HTML, and fixed some HTML coding errors.
Checked the files to be functional, deployed application

Created GitHub repository with README file and name it responsiveportfoliomerdad

Linked all navbars to the other files, so the other files can be easily accessible and named them About, Contact, and Portfolio pages. and each title was link to same file and content.
Created a pdf resume file and put it in Google doc for download.
Made my Slack Overflow account.
Made sure that all links works. Tried to use semantic html element as much that I can.
Added my own personal information. (bio, name, images, linked to my email and GitHub).
Added icones and links of gitHub, linkedIn, Slack Overflow, and several repositories.
 
• Usage: 
1-	tps://validator.w3.org/  helps to check and fix the HTML fils
2-	https://getbootstrap.com/  providing prepared html, css, js codes and safes time for coders and is it so reliable to make responsive web pages.
3-	https://www.w3schools.com/ provides prepared executive codes to safe time for coders.
